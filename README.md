# Sample Storage - analyses
___
This repository (R project) contains all data and scripts necessary to run the analyses and produce the figures from the study Treated like dirt: Robust forensic and ecological inferences from soil eDNA after challenging sample storage (Fr√∏slev et al. (2022) - published in Environmental DNA).
The intention is that all data is available to jump into the analyses at any given step (as intermediate data is available). All you need to do is to download the R project including data from this GitHub repository (https://github.com/tobiasgf/sample_storage).
If you wish to start from raw un-demultiplexed data, you also need to download the raw Illumina data from Dryad (LINK)
If you want to start from sample-wise demultiplexed paired reads, you need to download these from ENA/SRA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB56039).
Most of the analyses are carried out in R (with standard packages), but there are also some command line steps. To be able tu run all analyses, you need some additional tools installed (ITSx, cutadapt, snasltx, sickle)

*An overview and description of the directories and scripts in this repository*  

Directories|contents  
--- | ---   
asv_tables|contains all the 10 tables from the primary dada2 analyses (see above), as well as the downstream versions, where datasets are combined   
Asv_tables_referencedata|contais the four asv_tables from the reference data (and some information on replicates for two of them)
Basic_data|contains data for co2 measurements, dna concentration, and some basic sample meta data
Final_plots|contains plots from r as well as the publication ready plots as pdf (with some editing done in Adobe Illustrator)
Partial_plots|contains marker wise plots (that are later combined into final compound plots)
Processed_data|contains marker-wise stats and results from different analyses
R|contains some scripts for statistical analyses and plot making
Raw_reads|the directory for the raw fastq reads and demultiplexed reads (both needs downloading), as well as datafile necessary for the demultiplexing
Ressources|contains some external ressources for the habitat classification as well as reference datasets for the taxonomic annotation
Tables|output tables for publication
Taxonomic_assignments| contains info and tables related to the taxonomic annotation of reads.

The following scripts are used in the listed order to do the analyses, statistics and plotting of the study
